### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student in Noroff's frontend developer program and will finish my degree 16 october 2022.
My work is all made from assignments and exam's during my frontend program. You can view my portfolio site which you find below. 
I am interested in learning new technologies and to make websites with a minimalistic and clean design. 
I have been working mostly with React.js and vanilla JS, but also got some basic knowledge about Angular which i studied on my own.
